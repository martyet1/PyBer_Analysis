# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview:
_ -My assignment was to analyze ridesharing data by city type for PyBer. The analysis was to be presented in a way that enabled management to make business decisions using the data.
- The analysis included total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fares per ride and total fares by city type.

## Results
- The city types were rural, suburban and urban.
- The data was collected for January through April 2019.
- For total rides, total drivers and total fares rural had the least followed by suburban and urban with the highest numbers.
- For average fares and average fare per ride the opposit is true. Rural was the highest, followed by suburban and then urban.

## Summary
- As shown by the Total Fares by City Type graph the lowest was rural followed by suburban and then urban.
- The trend remained consistant for the period except during April where Total Fares increased for suburban while there was a downard trend in rural and urban.
- Following are three areas that should be looked into:
  - Average fares were higher in rural, most likely due to a less dense population resulting in longer rides. Perhaps a campaign could be launched that     would increase the number of drivers and rides. This will result in higher profit.
  - The April trends should be studied to see why there was an increase in suburban and a decrease in rural and urban.
  - There should be a study to determine how to increase the number of drivers and rides for all three city types.
